INSTRUCTIONS:

* To run the code
1. Download the github repo as zip or pull, (Professor we have added you as a contributor, you have access)
2. Open the folder in your IDE. (In my case, I have used VSCode for the entire project.)
3. Once the folder is open, click on 'main.py' and the run button in the top right. (Or you can run through terminal, like any other .py script)
4. When the program runs, it will update the 'output.txt' file present in the same folder directory, and there will be a output in the console showing the execution time for each case.
5. This should be it, the script should run with no errors and produce results in 'output.txt'.

If you have any issues you can email us.
Thank You
